This is a Pacman​ game agent that uses the Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path for Ghost​ to the Pacman target to chase it. Each time Pacman​ changes position, a new shortest path is generated for the Ghost to follow​. 

The project can be run on any editor, but preferably PyCharm as it is best suited for python libraries. Please run main.py.
