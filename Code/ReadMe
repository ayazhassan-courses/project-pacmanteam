This is a Pacman​ game agent that uses the Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path for one [red] Ghost​ to the Pacman target to chase it. Each time Pacman​ changes position, a new shortest path is generated for the [red] Ghost to follow​. 
In a comparative analysis to show Dijkstra is indeed taking the shortest route, the program deploys another [blue] Ghost that will follow the path generated by the Depth-First Search algorithm, which does not guarantee the shortest path, rather will generate random path.

The project can be run on any editor, but preferably PyCharm as it is best suited for python libraries.

This repository includes a PacMan game program using Python and the Pygame library. The basic logic on which our Pacman agent runs is adapted from this resource.
